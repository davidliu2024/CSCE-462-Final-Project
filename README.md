# VolleyBall Buddy

## Overview

VolleyBall Buddy is a computer vision project designed to enhance the game of volleyball by providing real-time tracking and analysis of proper volleyball sets. The project utilizes Python and OpenCV to detect and track the movement of the volleyball during sets, ensuring accurate and fair gameplay.

## Features

1. **Real-time Tracking:** VolleyBall Buddy employs computer vision techniques to track the movement of the volleyball in real-time. This allows for precise monitoring of sets during the game.

2. **Set Analysis:** The system analyzes the trajectory and positioning of the volleyball to determine whether a set is within the defined parameters of a proper set in volleyball. It provides instant feedback on the quality of each set via a beeping noise

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV:** The computer vision library employed for detecting and tracking the volleyball.
- **Raspberry Pi** The entire code base can be hosted on a raspberry pi
